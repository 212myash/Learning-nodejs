What is Streams in Node.js?

Streams allow us to process data in chunks instead of loading the entire file into memory.

Types of Streams:

1. Readable Stream
Used to read data.
Example: fs.createReadStream()

2. Writable Stream
Used to write data.
Example: fs.createWriteStream()

3. Duplex Stream
Readable + Writable both.
Example: net.Socket()

4. Transform Stream
Modify data while streaming.
Example: zlib.createGzip()
